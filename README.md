# Predicting-Credit-Risk-for-Loan-Applicants
The Credit Risk Prediction App is designed to predict whether a borrower poses a "Good" or "Bad" credit risk based on various features from a credit dataset. The app leverages machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify individuals based on their credit information.
